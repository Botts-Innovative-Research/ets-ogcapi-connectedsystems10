# Operational Status — OGC API Connected Systems ETS

Last updated: 2026-05-05T20:35Z

## Fresh-Session Entry Point

Start future sessions in:

```bash
cd /home/nh/docker/gir/ets-ogcapi-connectedsystems10
```

Read these first:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `ops/SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-05-05-ETS-REPO-MIGRATION.md`
- `openspec/capabilities/ets-ogcapi-connectedsystems/spec.md`
- `_bmad/traceability.md`
- `.harness/handoffs/planner-handoff.yaml`
- `.harness/contracts/sprint-ets-11.yaml`

## Current State

The active project has moved from the frozen `csapi_compliance` web app repo into this Java/TestNG TeamEngine ETS repo.

Migrated context now lives here:

- `.harness/`
- `openspec/`
- `_bmad/`
- `epics/`
- selected `ops/*.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `scripts/orchestrate.py`
- `scripts/session-metrics.py`

Existing ETS evidence in `ops/test-results/` and `ops/server.md` was preserved.

## Current Code State

- ETS HEAD at Sprint 11 Generator start: `5cdcdf4`
- Latest csapi docs handoff commit before migration: `1568f36`
- Latest implemented story: `S-ETS-10-01` Generator complete; Quinn gate approved with concerns and Raze Gate 4 approved
- Current sprint status: Sprint ets-11 AdvancedFiltering read-only subset Generator complete; Raze implementation review approved with concerns and commit plus independent Quinn/Raze gates are next

## Sprint ets-11 Plan

AdvancedFiltering systems/common-resource read-only subset:

- Story: `epics/stories/s-ets-11-01-advanced-filtering-readonly.md`
- Contract: `.harness/contracts/sprint-ets-11.yaml`
- OpenSpec: `REQ-ETS-PART1-009`, status SPECIFIED for Sprint 11
- Scope: declaration-gated `/conf/advanced-filtering`, local ID_List helper, `/systems?id=...`, `/systems?q=...`, `/systems?geom=...` smoke shape, and `advancedfiltering -> systemfeatures` dependency wiring
- Explicitly excluded: create-replace-delete, update, Part 2, full association filters, full geometry intersection semantics, combined-filter truth tables, and endpoint parity across every resource type
- GeoRobotix planning state: `/conformance` does not currently declare `/conf/advanced-filtering`; undeclared read-only query behavior is planning evidence only, not conformance PASS evidence

Sprint 11 Generator guardrails:

- Raze planning review gaps were addressed by making ID/keyword filters non-vacuous after seed selection, adding explicit ID_List examples, and separating dependency evidence from default smoke totals.
- Raze gap-fix review: `.harness/evaluations/sprint-ets-11-plan-gapfix.yaml` APPROVE 0.92, static-only per instruction.
- Re-verify `/conformance` before implementing.
- All AdvancedFiltering tests must SKIP-with-reason when `/conf/advanced-filtering` is absent.
- Do not add POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests.
- Do not promote REQ-ETS-PART1-009 beyond PARTIAL-IMPLEMENTED after this sprint.

## Sprint ets-11 Generator Evidence

AdvancedFiltering systems/common-resource read-only subset:

- `AdvancedFilteringTests.java` added with 6 read-only @Tests.
- `testng.xml` wires `<group name="advancedfiltering" depends-on="systemfeatures"/>`.
- `VerifyTestNGSuiteDependency` adds 3 AdvancedFiltering lint tests.
- Current GeoRobotix `/conformance` does not declare `/conf/advanced-filtering`; all 6 AdvancedFiltering @Tests SKIP-with-reason in default smoke.
- No POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE calls were introduced.

Verification:

- Java formatter via Docker Maven - BUILD SUCCESS
- `bash scripts/mvn-test-via-docker.sh` - BUILD SUCCESS, `98 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 3 skipped`
- TeamEngine smoke from `/tmp/sprint-ets-11-generator-smoke` - `63 total / 48 passed / 0 failed / 15 skipped`
- Smoke report: `/tmp/sprint-ets-11-generator-smoke-results/s-ets-01-03-teamengine-smoke-2026-05-05.xml`
- Container log: `/tmp/sprint-ets-11-generator-smoke-results/s-ets-01-03-teamengine-container-2026-05-05.log`

## Sprint ets-10 Evidence

SensorML systems read-only subset:

- `SensorMlTests.java` added with 6 read-only @Tests
- `testng.xml` wires `<group name="sensorml" depends-on="systemfeatures"/>`
- VerifyTestNGSuiteDependency adds 3 SensorML lint tests
- Full REQ-ETS-PART1-013 remains open for `mediatype-write`, `relation-types`, deployment/procedure/property SensorML schema/mapping, and full SensorML 3.0 JSON Schema validation

Verification:

- Generator: Java formatter via Docker Maven - BUILD SUCCESS
- Generator: `bash scripts/mvn-test-via-docker.sh` - BUILD SUCCESS, `95 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 3 skipped`
- Generator TeamEngine smoke from `/tmp/sprint-ets-10-generator-smoke-git-r2` - `57 total / 48 passed / 0 failed / 9 skipped`
- Quinn independent Maven from `/tmp/quinn-sprint-ets-10` - BUILD SUCCESS, `95 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 3 skipped`; surefire includes the three SensorML lint tests
- Quinn independent TeamEngine smoke with unique container `quinn-ets-csapi-smoke-s10` - `57 total / 48 passed / 0 failed / 9 skipped`
- SensorML runtime - 6 PASS; current GeoRobotix direct item `Accept: application/sml+json` falls back to explicit `application/sml+json` alternate link `https://api.georobotix.io/ogc/t18/api/systems/0mqcvdnfoca0?f=sml3`
- Collection-level `GET /systems` `items` JSON is not counted as SensorML PASS
- Raze implementation review initially found two gaps; both were fixed same-turn.
- Raze gap-fix review: `.harness/evaluations/sprint-ets-10-adversarial-gapfix.yaml` APPROVE 0.93, no final blockers.
- Quinn gate: `.harness/evaluations/sprint-ets-10-evaluator-gate.yaml` APPROVE_WITH_CONCERNS 0.91; no blockers.
- Raze Gate 4: `.harness/evaluations/sprint-ets-10-adversarial-gate.yaml` APPROVE 0.91; independent Maven from `/tmp/raze-sprint-ets-10` BUILD SUCCESS `95 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 3 skipped`; independent TeamEngine smoke with `SMOKE_CONTAINER_NAME=raze-ets-csapi-smoke-s10` reported `57 total / 48 passed / 0 failed / 9 skipped`.

## Sprint ets-09 Evidence

GeoJSON systems read-only subset:

- `GeoJsonTests.java` added with 5 read-only @Tests
- `testng.xml` wires `<group name="geojson" depends-on="systemfeatures"/>`
- VerifyTestNGSuiteDependency adds 3 GeoJSON lint tests
- Full REQ-ETS-PART1-012 remains open for `mediatype-write`, `relation-types`, and non-system GeoJSON schema/mapping subrequirements

Verification:

- Generator: `bash scripts/mvn-test-via-docker.sh` — BUILD SUCCESS, `92 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 3 skipped`
- Generator TeamEngine smoke from `/tmp/sprint-ets-09-smoke-fix` — `51 total / 42 passed / 0 failed / 9 skipped`
- Quinn independent Maven from `/tmp/quinn-sprint-ets-09` — BUILD SUCCESS, `92 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 3 skipped`
- Quinn independent TeamEngine smoke with unique container name — `51 total / 42 passed / 0 failed / 9 skipped`
- Raze independent Maven from `/tmp/raze-sprint-ets-09-review` — BUILD SUCCESS, `92 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 3 skipped`
- Raze independent TeamEngine smoke — `51 total / 42 passed / 0 failed / 9 skipped`
- GeoJSON runtime — 2 PASS + 3 SKIP; current GeoRobotix `items` JSON is not counted as GeoJSON PASS

Gate Results:

- `.harness/evaluations/sprint-ets-09-adversarial-implementation.yaml` — GAPS_FOUND 0.86 on mediatype-read overclaim
- `.harness/evaluations/sprint-ets-09-adversarial-gapfix.yaml` — APPROVE 0.94 after `b4a97de`
- `.harness/evaluations/sprint-ets-09-evaluator-gate.yaml` — Quinn APPROVE_WITH_CONCERNS 0.90; no blockers
- `.harness/evaluations/sprint-ets-09-adversarial-gate.yaml` — Raze APPROVE_WITH_CONCERNS 0.88; no required fixes

## Next Action

1. Commit Sprint ets-11 Generator implementation.
2. Run independent Quinn and Raze gates before closing Sprint 11.

## Dirty Worktree Notes

The repo already had unrelated modified scripts before this migration:

- `scripts/credential-leak-e2e-test.sh`
- `scripts/credential-leak-integration-test.sh`
- `scripts/mvn-test-via-docker.sh`
- `scripts/sabotage-test.sh`
- `scripts/smoke-test.sh`
- `scripts/stub-iut.sh`

The previously untracked `*:Zone.Identifier` files were removed on 2026-05-05 after explicit user instruction. Worktree was clean at Sprint 10 planning start and implementation start. No dirty files are expected after the Sprint 10 gate-close commit.
