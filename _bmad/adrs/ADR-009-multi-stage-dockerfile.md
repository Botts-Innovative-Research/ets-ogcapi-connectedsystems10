# ADR-009 — Multi-Stage Dockerfile Pattern: `eclipse-temurin:17-jdk` Build Stage + `tomcat:8.5-jre17` Runtime Stage

- **Status**: Accepted (forward-looking; binds S-ETS-02-05 implementation)
- **Date**: 2026-04-28
- **Decider**: Architect (Alex)
- **Related**: ADR-007 (base image deviation; this ADR builds on it), REQ-ETS-TEAMENGINE-003 (Dockerfile), REQ-ETS-CLEANUP-004 (NEW Sprint 2 — Dockerfile multi-stage + non-root USER), Quinn s03 SMOKE-TEST-DEP-CLOSURE-WORKFLOW concern, Raze s03 CONCERN-2 + CONCERN-3
- **Supersedes**: none (Sprint 1 single-stage Dockerfile is preserved as-is at HEAD `8aeffbf` — this ADR is the Sprint 2 forward path)

## Context

Sprint 1's S-ETS-01-03 Dockerfile (per ADR-007) is **single-stage**. `target/lib-runtime/` is staged **outside** Docker via `scripts/smoke-test.sh` calling `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies` against the host's `~/.m2/`. This works for a developer with a populated `~/.m2/` but has two real problems Raze s03 CONCERN-2 + CONCERN-3 surfaced:

1. **Fresh-CI brittleness**. A clean GitHub Actions runner with empty `~/.m2/` must download the entire ets-common:17 + Jersey 3.x + REST-Assured + jts-core dep tree on every CI run — 5-10 minutes per invocation, plus exposure to Maven Central / OSSRH intermittent outages.
2. **Image is not self-contained**. A reviewer who clones the repo on a host with no Maven cannot `docker build .` and get a working image; they must first `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies` outside Docker. CITE SC reviewers do exactly this kind of cold-cache reproduction.

S-ETS-02-05 closes both via a multi-stage Dockerfile. The architect must pick **one** of three patterns Pat enumerated:

| Option | What it does | Build cost | CI cold-cache cost | Image size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (a) Build stage = Maven container; `mvn dependency:resolve` + `mvn package` inside container; runtime stage `COPY --from=build` | Full mvn lifecycle in Docker | ~30-60s warm; ~4-6 min cold | One-time Maven download per `docker build`; cacheable via BuildKit | Smallest (~400MB target) |
| (b) Build stage = TomCat container with mvn; pre-staged `target/lib-runtime/` (current pattern, just split) | Layer split only | Same as Sprint 1 | No improvement on host-`~/.m2`-dep | Same (~600MB) |
| (c) `pom.xml` profile bakes deps closure at `mvn package` time; Dockerfile just COPYs | Move dep-staging to Maven | Adds 10-20s to every `mvn package` | Same as today (host `~/.m2` still needed at mvn time, but now during `mvn package` not `docker build`) | Smaller than (b) but larger than (a) |

Architect picks **(a)** for these reasons:

1. **Most reproducible across host environments**. A reviewer with only Docker installed (no Maven, no JDK) can `git clone && docker build .` and get a working image. CITE SC reproduction friction is minimized.
2. **CI cold-cache cost is amortized via BuildKit cache mount**. `--mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2` persists across `docker build` invocations on the same runner; the second CI run is fast even with no host-`~/.m2/`.
3. **Build environment is hermetic**. The Maven version, JDK version, settings.xml are baked into the build stage's image and don't drift with what the developer happens to have installed locally.
4. **Aligns with the OGC ETS catalog convention** — `features10@java17Tomcat10TeamEngine6`'s emerging Dockerfile draft uses the same Maven+Tomcat split.

Option (b) is rejected because it doesn't actually fix the problem (host `~/.m2/` is still required). Option (c) is rejected because it pushes the hermeticity problem upstream into Maven (now `mvn package` requires `~/.m2/` to be populated; same brittleness, different layer).

## Decision

Sprint 2 S-ETS-02-05 SHALL rewrite the Dockerfile as a two-stage build:

### Stage 1 — Build (`builder`)

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-jammy AS builder

# Install Maven 3.9.9 — match the ets-common-enforced version (ADR-004 A-5)
ARG MAVEN_VERSION=3.9.9
RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates \
 && curl -fsSL "https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/${MAVEN_VERSION}/binaries/apache-maven-${MAVEN_VERSION}-bin.tar.gz" \
    | tar -xz -C /opt \
 && ln -s /opt/apache-maven-${MAVEN_VERSION}/bin/mvn /usr/local/bin/mvn \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /build

# Copy pom.xml first to maximize layer cache for offline-resolution (deps don't change every commit)
COPY pom.xml ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2 \
    mvn -B -q dependency:go-offline

# Now copy source (every commit invalidates this layer; OK because deps are cached)
COPY src ./src
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2 \
    mvn -B -q clean package -DskipTests \
 && mvn -B -q dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=target/lib-runtime -DincludeScope=runtime \
 && rm -f target/lib-runtime/teamengine-*.jar
```

### Stage 2 — Runtime (`tomcat:8.5-jre17`)

Per ADR-007, runtime stage stays on `tomcat:8.5-jre17` with the 3 secondary patches.

```dockerfile

### Layer ordering rationale (build-time cache efficiency)

Cheapest-to-most-expensive ordering keeps unchanged layers cached:

| Layer order | Why this position |
|---|---|
| Stage 1: Maven install | Changes only when MAVEN_VERSION ARG changes (rare) |
| Stage 1: `COPY pom.xml` + `mvn dependency:go-offline` | Changes only when pom.xml does (every dep update — periodic) |
| Stage 1: `COPY src` + `mvn package` | Changes every commit (frequent) — placed last |
| Stage 2: apt-get + TE WAR download | Changes only when TEAMENGINE_VERSION ARG changes (rare) |
| Stage 2: VirtualWebappLoader strip + JAXB jars | Changes only when ADR-007 secondary patches evolve (rare) |
| Stage 2: `COPY --from=builder` | Changes every commit (frequent) — placed late |
| Stage 2: USER + ENV + HEALTHCHECK + CMD | Cheap; placed last |

### USER directive rules

- Create a system group `tomcat` (no login, no shell, no home directory creation beyond `/usr/local/tomcat`).
- Create a system user `tomcat` belonging to that group.
- `chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat` BEFORE the USER directive (`chown` requires root).
- Switch to USER tomcat. The CMD `catalina.sh run` runs as the unprivileged user.
- Required for REQ-ETS-CLEANUP-004 acceptance criterion ("Container runs as non-root, verified via `docker run ... id` showing non-zero UID").

### Image size target

- Single-stage Sprint 1 image: ~600 MB (per ADR-007 §Consequences).
- Multi-stage target: ≤ 450 MB (S-ETS-02-05 sub-task A acceptance threshold; soft target 400 MB).
- Savings come from: (a) build stage discarded (Maven + JDK 17-jdk + ~/.m2 cache = ~500 MB excluded), (b) duplicate jars between TE common-libs and our deps removed by dedupe RUN steps if needed (defer to Sprint 3 if 450 MB is missed).

### `scripts/smoke-test.sh` simplification

Post-multi-stage, `scripts/smoke-test.sh` SHALL:

- DROP the `mvn -B -q clean package -DskipTests` step (line 67 in current).
- DROP the `mvn -B -q dependency:copy-dependencies` step (line 75 in current).
- Keep step 1 ("staging build artifacts") only as a sanity check (`docker build .` is the now-canonical staging).

This eliminates the host `~/.m2` dependency; smoke-test runs cleanly on a runner with only Docker installed.

## Alternatives considered

- **Option (b) — pre-staged `target/lib-runtime/`** (rejected, see §Context). Doesn't fix host-`~/.m2` dep; just splits layers cosmetically.
- **Option (c) — bake into pom.xml profile** (rejected, see §Context). Pushes hermeticity problem one layer up.
- **Distroless runtime stage** (`gcr.io/distroless/java17-debian12`) (rejected for Sprint 2). Distroless eliminates apt-get / curl / sed at runtime, shrinking image to ~250 MB, but: (a) Tomcat 8.5 is not pre-installed in distroless — would need to overlay; (b) the 3 secondary patches per ADR-007 (VirtualWebappLoader strip uses sed; JAXB jars via curl; both at image-build time) can be done in stage 1 before distroless final, but adds complexity. Defer to Sprint 5+ at the earliest.
- **Single-stage with `--mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2`** (rejected). The mount is a build-time cache, not a runtime layer. The cached Maven repo lives at `~/.m2` inside the container during `docker build` only; it is NOT shipped in the final image. So a single-stage Dockerfile with `--mount=cache` does eliminate fresh-CI brittleness — but image still contains the JDK and Maven (build tools), bloating size. Multi-stage is strictly better.
- **Use BuildKit's `--platform=linux/arm64`** for Apple Silicon support (deferred). Out of Sprint 2 scope. The current ETS jar is JDK bytecode = platform-independent; the only platform-sensitive layers are the base images (`eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-jammy` and `tomcat:8.5-jre17` both publish multi-arch). When demand surfaces, add `--platform` to the GitHub Actions build matrix.
- **Add `mvn test` to stage 1** (rejected). Tests are run via `mvn -B clean install` in CI before `docker build`; baking them into the image build re-runs the surefire suite on every Docker build. Wastes 30s per build. The `target/*.jar` produced by `-DskipTests` in the build stage is byte-identical to the one produced by `install` (per Sprint 1 reproducibility evidence).

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- Fresh-CI runners with no `~/.m2` cache complete `docker build .` end-to-end in ~5-6 min cold (Maven dep download), ~30-90 sec warm (BuildKit cache hit). Eliminates Quinn s03 SMOKE-TEST-DEP-CLOSURE-WORKFLOW concern and Raze s03 CONCERN-2/3.
- Image is self-contained — `git clone && docker build .` is the only command needed. Maximizes CITE SC reviewer reproducibility.
- USER tomcat directive closes REQ-ETS-CLEANUP-004 + brings the image in line with security baselines for OCI containers (CIS Docker Benchmark §4.1).
- Layer cache discipline minimizes per-commit Docker build cost (only the source-COPY + mvn-package layer invalidates on most commits).
- `scripts/smoke-test.sh` simplifies — fewer environmental prerequisites = fewer ways to break.

**Negative**:
- Build stage adds ~100 MB intermediate image (eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-jammy is ~440 MB compressed; ours adds Maven 3.9.9 ~10 MB). Discarded after build, but disk space briefly consumed. Acceptable.
- BuildKit must be enabled for `--mount=type=cache` to work. Modern Docker (>= 19.03) and GitHub Actions have it enabled by default; ops/server.md should record `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` as a (defensive) env var.
- The `mvn dependency:go-offline` step in stage 1 doesn't fully resolve all plugins because Maven plugin classes are loaded reflectively. ~10% of `mvn package` time still requires online access for stragglers. Mitigated by BuildKit cache; for fully-offline builds add `mvn -o package` (offline mode) after a successful initial cache populate.
- Filtering `teamengine-*-6.0.0.jar` from `target/lib-runtime/` happens inside stage 1 (per the Dockerfile snippet above, `&& rm -f target/lib-runtime/teamengine-*.jar`). If ets-common ever bumps to TE 7.x, the wildcard pattern needs updating. Mitigated by smoke-test catching the SPI-collision symptom.

**Risks**:
- BuildKit cache layout is not stable across Docker versions; an upgrade may invalidate the `--mount=type=cache` cache and force a full re-download. Mitigation: document the cache-clear behavior in ops/server.md and accept the occasional cold rebuild.
- `eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-jammy` Docker tag may be deprecated in favor of a different distribution name in the future. Mitigation: pin the tag explicitly with the digest at S-ETS-02-05 close (`FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-jammy@sha256:<digest>`); periodic re-pin via `ops/server.md` "Docker base image cadence" section.
- The non-root USER tomcat directive may break smoke-test.sh's container-log fetching if Tomcat's log dir was previously root-owned. Mitigated by `chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat` BEFORE the USER directive (writes /usr/local/tomcat/logs/* are now owned by tomcat).

## Sprint 3 Amendment (2026-04-29) — Image-Size Optimization via TE common-libs ↔ deps-closure dedupe

**Trigger**: Sprint 2 Quinn cleanup GAP-1 + Raze cleanup CONCERN-2 surfaced that the multi-stage Dockerfile shipped at ~570MB, missing the 450MB target. The §Negative bullet 4 above explicitly anticipated this: "duplicate jars between TE common-libs and our deps removed by dedupe RUN steps if needed (defer to Sprint 3 if 450 MB is missed)." Sprint 3 S-ETS-03-04 closes this gap.

### Decision (Sprint 3 increment)

**Architect ratifies Pat's option (a): TE common-libs ↔ deps-closure dedupe.** Rejects (b) distroless (still deferred per §Alternatives — Sprint 5+ at earliest) and (c) alpine refinement (~50-100MB savings is insufficient; the JAR-deduplication path delivers 200-300MB and is the documented Sprint 3 carryover).

### Empirical TE common-libs vs deps-closure overlap

The TeamEngine 5.6.1 `teamengine-web-common-libs.zip` (extracted to `/usr/local/tomcat/lib/`) ships a base set of jars that the ETS jar's `target/lib-runtime/` (extracted to `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/teamengine/WEB-INF/lib/`) ALSO redundantly contains. Both classpaths are loaded by Tomcat at runtime; the WEB-INF/lib copies SHADOW the common-libs copies, contributing pure bloat. The empirical overlap (per Generator's pre-Sprint-3 enumeration via `unzip -l teamengine-web-common-libs.zip | awk '{print $4}' | sort -u`) includes (verify-then-exclude pattern):

| jar group | example pattern | size | rationale for exclusion |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jakarta Servlet API | `jakarta.servlet-api-*.jar` (~ 1MB) | low | Already provided by Tomcat 8.5 + TE common-libs; WEB-INF copy unused |
| JAX-RS API + Jersey core | `jersey-*.jar`, `jakarta.ws.rs-api-*.jar` (~ 5-15 MB) | medium | TE common-libs provides Jersey 2.x; ETS uses Jersey 3.x → KEEP ETS copy, EXCLUDE TE copy if version conflict (Generator verifies via `find /usr/local/tomcat -name "jersey-*.jar"`) |
| Apache Commons (lang3, io, codec) | `commons-*.jar` (~ 2-5 MB) | low | Both classpaths ship the same versions; WEB-INF copy is redundant |
| Logging (slf4j, logback, log4j) | `slf4j-*.jar`, `logback-*.jar` (~ 3-5 MB) | low | TE common-libs provides slf4j-api; ETS provides slf4j-api + logback-classic — KEEP ETS logback, EXCLUDE WEB-INF slf4j-api duplicate |
| XML (Xerces, JAXB, Saxon) | `xerces*.jar`, `jaxb-*.jar`, `Saxon-*.jar` (~ 50-80 MB) | **high** | TE common-libs ships Saxon-HE 9.x; ETS doesn't need XSLT — verify ETS copy is absent or remove if present |
| TestNG | `testng-*.jar` (~ 5 MB) | low | TE common-libs provides TestNG 7.x; ETS test-scope dep should not ship to WEB-INF — verify scope=test in pom |
| YAML / Jackson | `jackson-*.jar`, `snakeyaml-*.jar` (~ 5-10 MB) | medium | Both classpaths may ship; KEEP ETS copy (newer), EXCLUDE TE copy via filter if version conflict |
| **Estimated total reclaim** |  | **200-300 MB** | per Quinn cleanup GAP-1 estimate |

### Implementation pattern (Generator verifies empirically)

S-ETS-03-04 EXTENDS Stage 1 of the Dockerfile with a `dedupe` RUN step that runs AFTER `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies` and BEFORE the final `target/lib-runtime/` is COPIED to Stage 2:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1 (builder), AFTER mvn dependency:copy-dependencies, BEFORE the COPY --from=builder:
#
# Dedupe: remove jars from target/lib-runtime/ that TE common-libs already provides.
# Generator MUST first enumerate empirically:
#   docker run --rm <stage1-image> bash -c \
#     "comm -12 <(ls target/lib-runtime/ | sort) <(unzip -l /tmp/te-common-libs.zip | awk '{print \$4}' | xargs -n1 basename | sort)"
# Then bake the empirical exclusion list into this RUN step.
RUN cd target/lib-runtime \
 && rm -f \
    jersey-common-2.*.jar \
    jersey-server-2.*.jar \
    jakarta.servlet-api-*.jar \
    commons-lang3-*.jar \
    commons-io-*.jar \
    slf4j-api-*.jar \
    Saxon-HE-*.jar \
    snakeyaml-*.jar \
    # ... (full list per empirical enumeration; comments indicating TE common-libs version)
 && true  # idempotent; missing jars don't fail the build
```

**The exclusion list MUST be derived empirically by Generator** (the table above is illustrative; real overlap depends on the exact Maven dep tree at S-ETS-03-04 implementation time). The acceptance criterion: `docker images --format '{{.Size}}' ets-ogcapi-connectedsystems10:latest` reports ≤ 450 MB after the dedupe step (Sprint 2 missed this; Sprint 3 closes it).

### Verification approach

1. **Pre-dedupe baseline**: Generator records the current image size (Sprint 2 close ~570 MB) in S-ETS-03-04 Implementation Notes.
2. **Empirical enumeration**: Generator runs the comm-comparison commands above against an interim Stage 1 image; archives the duplicate-jar list to `ops/test-results/sprint-ets-03-04-dedupe-enumeration.txt`.
3. **Dedupe RUN step added**: Generator commits the Dockerfile edit with the EMPIRICAL exclusion list (NOT the illustrative table above).
4. **Smoke verification**: `scripts/smoke-test.sh` runs end-to-end against the deduped image; 12/12+ PASS preserved (no jar removed should be one the ETS code actually loads — `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError` would surface immediately).
5. **Size verification**: `docker images --format '{{.Size}}' ets-ogcapi-connectedsystems10:latest` reports ≤ 450 MB; archived as `ops/test-results/sprint-ets-03-04-image-size.txt`.

### Why not the other options

- **Option (b) distroless runtime stage**: Still deferred per original §Alternatives. Distroless saves ~150 MB by removing apt + curl + sed, but: (i) the 3 secondary patches in stage 2 (VirtualWebappLoader strip via sed; JAXB jars via curl) would need to be moved to stage 1 (added complexity); (ii) Tomcat 8.5 is not pre-installed in any distroless variant — would need to overlay TE WAR + Tomcat onto distroless/java17 (significant extra work for the marginal ~150 MB beyond what dedupe achieves). Sprint 5+ at earliest, after Common + Subsystems + Procedures conformance classes ship.
- **Option (c) alpine multi-stage refinement**: Saves only ~50-100 MB (replacing tomcat:8.5-jre17 (~280 MB) with a custom alpine + JRE 17 + Tomcat assembly (~180-230 MB)). The savings are real but the alpine ecosystem (musl libc) introduces compatibility risk for native libs in TestNG/REST-Assured. The dedupe path achieves 2-3x more savings with zero compatibility risk. Reject.

### Consequences (Sprint 3 increment)

**Positive**:
- Closes Quinn cleanup GAP-1 (image size > 450 MB target) and Raze cleanup CONCERN-2 (ADR-009 deferral language clarification).
- Reproducible: the empirical exclusion list is committed to the Dockerfile (no runtime auto-detection magic); same input produces same output.
- Forward-compatible with distroless future: when Sprint 5+ revisits distroless, the dedupe RUN step ports cleanly (it's an ETS-domain optimization, not a base-image-specific one).
- Documents the empirical enumeration methodology for future TE version bumps (TE 6.x will likely have a different common-libs set; Generator re-runs the comm-comparison and updates the exclusion list).

**Negative**:
- Exclusion list is empirical and brittle to TE version changes. Mitigation: comments in the Dockerfile indicate which TE version the list was derived against; smoke-test catches NoClassDefFoundError if a removed jar is actually needed.
- ~30 min Generator wall-clock for the empirical enumeration + verification cycle. Acceptable.

**Risks**:
- **NoClassDefFoundError from over-aggressive dedupe**. Mitigation: smoke runs end-to-end after each batch of exclusions; if any removed jar breaks 12/12 PASS, restore it and document in the exclusion list comments why it can't be excluded.
- **TE 6.x migration invalidates the exclusion list**. Mitigation: when TE bumps to 6.x, re-run the comm-comparison; the dedupe step is the lightest-touch part of the migration plan.

## Sprint 4 v2 amendment (2026-04-29) — chown-layer attack + Sprint 3 illustrative-table falsification

**Trigger**: Sprint 3 S-ETS-03-04 EMPIRICALLY FALSIFIED the Sprint 3 amendment's "200-300MB reclaim" projection. The deduce-list test results at `~/docker/gir/ets-ogcapi-connectedsystems10/ops/test-results/sprint-ets-03-04-empirical-dedupe-list-2026-04-29.txt` showed only **4 jars / ~1.8MB** of safe (exact-basename) overlap on the actual TE 5.6.1 + ETS 0.1-SNAPSHOT post-ADR-006 layout. The illustrative table in §"Sprint 3 Amendment" above (Jakarta Servlet API, JAX-RS API, Apache Commons, etc.) projected dedupe candidates that DID NOT MATERIALIZE because (a) ADR-006's Jakarta EE 9 / Jersey 3.x port mismatches every TE common-libs Jakarta EE 8 version (KEEP-both-due-to-version-mismatch dominates the overlap matrix), (b) most of the projected `commons-*` / `slf4j-*` overlaps in the illustrative table actually live on different version axes between TE common-libs and ETS deps-closure. Dedupe yielded only ~1.8MB savings; image size remained ~661MB at Sprint 3 close — well above the 450MB target ADR-009 §"Image size target" originally set, but acceptable given the empirically-revealed structural ceiling.

Sprint 3 also identified the **dominant remaining cost**: the `RUN groupadd ... && useradd ... && chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat` block at lines 116-117 of the Stage 2 Dockerfile rewrites the entire `/usr/local/tomcat` filesystem layer's ownership metadata, materializing as an **~80MB Docker layer** (filesystem-attribute-change layer). This is the largest single optimization target now visible.

### Decision (Sprint 4 v2 amendment)

**Architect ratifies in-place ADR-009 amendment** (Pat's option (a)) — REJECTS new ADR-011 superseding (Pat's option (b)). Justification:

1. **Sprint 2 NO-ADR-for-CredentialMaskingFilter precedent (§14.5 architecture.md)** — when a follow-on decision extends an existing ADR's scope without contradicting its core decision (multi-stage build is preserved; only the optimization tactic evolves), in-place amendment maintains a single source of truth.
2. **ADR-001 cross-reference amendment precedent (§14.7 architecture.md)** — minor empirical falsification of one parenthetical projection is the lightest-touch correction; full ADR-011 supersession would orphan the ADR-009 + ADR-009 Sprint 3 amendment audit trail.
3. **The core ADR-009 decision (multi-stage Dockerfile, build/runtime split, USER tomcat directive, BuildKit cache mount) is NOT being changed** — only the image-size optimization tactic shifts from "rely on TE common-libs ↔ deps-closure dedupe" to "use BuildKit `--chown=tomcat:tomcat` on COPY directives + smaller-than-projected dedupe + roadmap to alpine".
4. **ADR cardinality discipline** — Pat surfaced ADR-CARDINALITY-DRIFT (low severity); avoiding ADR-011 keeps the index manageable. (When the ADR set genuinely needs a navigation aid, that's a separate `_bmad/adrs/INDEX.md` task — not a justification for cosmetic ADR splits.)

### Empirical falsification record (Sprint 3 close)

Per `~/docker/gir/ets-ogcapi-connectedsystems10/ops/test-results/sprint-ets-03-04-empirical-dedupe-list-2026-04-29.txt`:

| Pre-Sprint-3 projection (illustrative table above) | Sprint 3 empirical result | Delta |
|---|---|---|
| 200-300MB reclaim via TE common-libs ↔ deps-closure dedupe | 4 jars / ~1.8MB exact-basename overlap | -198MB (projection wrong by 99%) |
| Jakarta Servlet API duplicate | NOT a duplicate (Jakarta EE 9 vs EE 8 version mismatch — KEEP both) | — |
| Jersey duplicates | NOT duplicates (Jersey 3.1.x vs 1.19 version mismatch — KEEP both per ADR-006) | — |
| Apache Commons duplicates | Live on different version axes between TE common-libs and ETS deps-closure | — |
| Saxon-HE duplicate (~50-80MB) | Not present in ETS deps-closure (no XSLT use) | — |

The 4 actual exact-basename overlaps (`schema-utils-1.8.jar`, `xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar`, `xml-apis-1.4.01.jar`, `xml-resolver-1.2.jar`) are kept in Sprint 4's dedupe RUN step but represent the structural ceiling for safe (zero-NoClassDefFoundError-risk) dedupe given the ADR-006 Jakarta EE 9 baseline.

### Sprint 4 chown-layer attack approach

S-ETS-04-02 SHALL refactor the Stage 2 Dockerfile's USER setup as follows:

1. **Move `groupadd` + `useradd` BEFORE all `COPY --from=builder` and TE-staging RUN steps** (so the `tomcat` user/group exist when the COPYs land).
2. **Replace every `COPY --from=builder` directive with `COPY --chown=tomcat:tomcat --from=builder`** — BuildKit applies ownership at COPY time without a follow-on filesystem rewrite.
3. **Replace TE WAR-extraction RUN steps' final state with chown-at-extraction** — either via running the `unzip` blocks inside a `--mount=type=bind` context that chowns inline, or (simpler) via switching ownership inside the same RUN step so the layer commit captures the final ownership without a separate `chown -R` rewrite layer.
4. **DELETE the standalone `RUN ... && chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat` block** (current lines 116-117). Retain `USER tomcat` directive immediately after the now-redundant chown removal.

Expected outcome: ~80MB filesystem-attribute layer eliminated. Combined with Sprint 3's existing ~1.8MB dedupe and Sprint 4 mechanical state, **target <600MB** (Sprint 4 contract `image_size_under_600mb`). PARTIAL acceptable at 600-650MB (chown-layer attack may underperform if BuildKit's `--chown` semantics still materialize a non-zero layer for large filesystems, e.g. 30-50MB).

USER tomcat
ENV JAVA_OPTS=...
ENV CATALINA_OPTS=...

```

**Caveat**: BuildKit's `--chown` on `COPY` is well-supported (Docker 17.09+); the per-step chown inside RUN blocks for the TE WAR/console extractions is the substantive change. Generator MUST verify at runtime that `docker images --format '{{.Size}}'` reports <600MB AND smoke 22+M PASS preserved (where M = Subsystems @Test count from S-ETS-04-05). PARTIAL acceptable at 600-650MB; tier-2 version-overlap dedupe (~7-8MB additional, per Sprint 3 empirical analysis intra-WEB-INF/lib duplicate-version artifacts table) permitted with per-jar smoke verification.

### Sprint 5+ alpine-variant roadmap

If Sprint 4 chown-attack hits 600-650MB PARTIAL and user prioritizes further size reduction, Sprint 5+ may pursue alpine-variant Stage 2:

- Replace `tomcat:8.5-jre17` (Debian-based, ~280MB) with a custom alpine + JRE 17 + Tomcat 8.5 assembly (~180-230MB; ~50-100MB savings)
- **Risks** (per original §Alternatives): musl libc compatibility for native libs in TestNG/REST-Assured (low risk for our pure-Java stack but unverified); apk vs apt for any future package additions; no upstream tomcat:alpine official image for Tomcat 8.5 specifically (would need a bespoke Dockerfile).
- **Trigger**: Sprint 4 close at PARTIAL with user-prioritized size reduction explicit. Otherwise this remains a noted-but-unscheduled future option.

Distroless (per original §Alternatives) remains deferred to Sprint 6+; the additional ~150MB savings is real but the migration cost (Tomcat overlay onto distroless/java17) outweighs the value for a project whose primary delivery vehicle is CITE SC submission, not size-optimized production deployment.

### Consequences (Sprint 4 v2 amendment increment)

**Positive**:
- Closes Sprint 3 carryover empirical-falsification gap (illustrative table now annotated as historically-superseded).
- ~80MB chown-layer attack delivers ~12% size reduction against Sprint 3 661MB baseline (target ~580MB).
- Forward-compatible with alpine + distroless future paths (chown-layer pattern ports cleanly).
- ADR-009 remains the single source of truth for image-build optimization decisions; no ADR-011 audit-trail fragmentation.

**Negative**:
- The Sprint 3 amendment's illustrative table now requires a "historically-superseded" mental tag for readers; mitigated by this Sprint 4 v2 amendment's explicit falsification record above.
- BuildKit `--chown` semantics may still materialize a non-zero layer for large filesystems; empirical verification required at S-ETS-04-02 close.

**Risks**:
- **CHOWN-LAYER-ATTACK-MAY-NOT-MATERIALIZE-EXPECTED-SAVINGS** (Pat surfaced; medium severity). Mitigation: PARTIAL acceptable at 600-650MB; tier-2 version-overlap dedupe fallback documented; alpine roadmap is the Sprint 5+ escalation path.
- **TE WAR/console RUN-step chown adding to layer size**: the per-step chown applied at the end of each TE-staging RUN is small (already-staged files) but non-zero. Net effect should be strictly less than the eliminated standalone `chown -R` layer. Generator empirically verifies.
