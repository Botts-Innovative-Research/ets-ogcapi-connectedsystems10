# Story: S-ETS-05-01 — GAP-1 wedge fix: wire SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL through smoke-test.sh → CTL → Java → REST-Assured header

**Epic**: epic-ets-04-teamengine-integration
**Sprint**: ets-05
**Priority**: P0 — GAP-1 cross-corroborated HIGH gap; closes S-ETS-04-03 PARTIAL
**Estimated Complexity**: M
**Status**: Active (Sprint 5)

## Description

Sprint 4 GAP-1 (cross-corroborated by Quinn 0.84 + Raze 0.84): `scripts/smoke-test.sh` has ZERO
references to `SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL`, `auth-credential`, or `Authorization`. The synthetic
credential set in `scripts/credential-leak-e2e-test.sh:118` is silently dropped when smoke-test.sh
runs as a child process. The MaskingRequestLoggingFilter is never exercised; the stub-IUT log shows
11 inbound requests ALL with `Authorization=<absent>`.

This story wires the missing plumbing so `SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL` flows end-to-end:

```
SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL (env) → smoke-test.sh (bash curl POST --data-urlencode)
  → TeamEngine CTL suite param `auth-credential`
  → Java SuiteFixtureListener reads suite param
  → CommonFixture or new AuthFixture injects into REST-Assured RequestSpec
  → MaskingRequestLoggingFilter intercepts the outgoing request log
  → masked form (Bear***WXYZ) appears in log; unmasked credential never in artifacts
```

Fix size: ~5 LOC bash (smoke-test.sh) + ~30-50 LOC Java (fixture reading param + injecting into
RequestSpec) + ~10-15 LOC Java unit test (VerifyAuthCredentialPropagation).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `grep -nE 'SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL|auth-credential' scripts/smoke-test.sh` returns non-empty
      (proves the wiring landed in code, not just in the wrapper script)
- [ ] `scripts/credential-leak-e2e-test.sh` runs end-to-end and produces three-fold verdict:
  - (a) `grep -r 'EFGH12345678WXYZ' $SMOKE_OUTPUT_DIR` returns ZERO hits
  - (b) `grep -rE 'Bear\*\*\*WXYZ' $SMOKE_OUTPUT_DIR` returns AT LEAST ONE hit
  - (c) stub-IUT log shows AT LEAST ONE request with `Authorization: Bearer ABCDEFGH12345678WXYZ`
        (proves the wire carried the credential to the IUT)
- [ ] New unit test `VerifyAuthCredentialPropagation.java` covers: SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL reads
      correctly; param passed to TestNG suite; REST-Assured RequestSpec includes Authorization header
- [ ] `mvn clean install` BUILD SUCCESS (surefire 64+N/0/0/3, where N is new unit tests)
- [ ] Smoke 26/26 PASS preserved after wiring changes (regression check)
- [ ] SCENARIO-ETS-CLEANUP-CREDENTIAL-LEAK-WIRING-001 and SCENARIO-ETS-CLEANUP-CREDENTIAL-LEAK-THREE-FOLD-001 PASS

## Spec References

- REQ-ETS-CLEANUP-011 (modified — re-opened from PARTIAL to IMPLEMENTED when this wiring fix lands)
- REQ-ETS-CLEANUP-006 (closes final deferral: deeper E2E at IUT-auth layer)

## Technical Notes

**Implementation path** (Generator must read each layer before editing):

1. **CTL file** (`src/main/scripts/ctl/ogcapi-connectedsystems10-suite.ctl`): Verify that
   `auth-credential` is already declared as a `ctl:form-param`. Per REQ-ETS-TEAMENGINE-002, the
   CTL wrapper already accepts `auth-credential`. If absent, add it as an optional param with
   default empty-string.

2. **smoke-test.sh**: In the `curl POST /suite/.../run` call, add:
   ```bash
   if [ -n "${SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL:-}" ]; then
     AUTH_PARAM="--data-urlencode auth-credential=${SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL}"
   fi
   curl ... $AUTH_PARAM ...
   ```
   ~5 LOC. The env var name matches what credential-leak-e2e-test.sh already sets.

3. **Java layer** (read SuiteFixtureListener.java and CommonFixture.java first):
   - If SuiteFixtureListener already reads `auth-credential` suite param and stores it
     in suite context, add the REST-Assured RequestSpec injection there or in CommonFixture.
   - If not present: add `String authCredential = suiteContext.getSuite().getParameter("auth-credential")`
     and inject into RequestSpec as `header("Authorization", authCredential)` ONLY when
     authCredential is non-null/non-empty. The MaskingRequestLoggingFilter is already wired
     to the RequestSpec (Sprint 3); it will intercept this header.

4. **Unit test** `VerifyAuthCredentialPropagation.java`:
   - Test 1: smoke-test.sh includes auth-credential in curl POST when SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL set
     (bash-level; use test fixture or parse script directly)
   - Test 2: SuiteFixtureListener correctly reads auth-credential param from TestNG suite context
   - Test 3: RequestSpec includes Authorization header when auth-credential is set

**Stub IUT pre-condition**: `scripts/stub-iut.sh` (from Sprint 4 S-ETS-04-03) must be running
on 0.0.0.0 (already fixed in Sprint 4 S-ETS-04-04); `scripts/smoke-test.sh` uses
`--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` (also already fixed). Both prerequisites are in
place at Sprint 5 start.

**Do NOT break the no-credential case**: When `SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL` is unset, smoke-test.sh
must behave identically to Sprint 4 close (no auth header injected; all existing smoke tests pass).

## Dependencies

- Sprint 4 S-ETS-04-04 bug fixes already in place (stub bind 0.0.0.0 + --add-host)
- Sprint 4 S-ETS-04-03 artifacts (stub-iut.sh + credential-leak-e2e-test.sh) already in place

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All three-fold cross-check SCENARIO-ETS-CLEANUP-CREDENTIAL-LEAK-* PASS
- [ ] VerifyAuthCredentialPropagation unit test PASS
- [ ] Smoke 26/26 PASS preserved (no regression)
- [ ] Spec implementation status updated: REQ-ETS-CLEANUP-013 SPECIFIED+IMPLEMENTED; REQ-ETS-CLEANUP-011 IMPLEMENTED
- [ ] Artifact: `ops/test-results/sprint-ets-05-01-credential-leak-full-<date>.txt` (three-fold live-exec evidence)

## Implementation Notes (Sprint 5 Run 1 — Dana Generator, 2026-04-29)

**Status**: IMPLEMENTED (Sprint 5 Run 1, 2026-04-29; pending Quinn+Raze gate close)

### Three-layer wiring (landed)

1. **Bash layer** (`scripts/smoke-test.sh`, ~14 LOC including comments):
   - When `SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL` is non-empty, `AUTH_CRED_ARGS=(--data-urlencode "auth-credential=$SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL")` is added to the existing Step 6 `curl POST /teamengine/rest/suites/{ets}/run` invocation.
   - When unset/empty, no auth-credential parameter is sent (Sprint 1-4 unauthenticated baseline preserved).
   - Verification: `grep -nE 'SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL|auth-credential' scripts/smoke-test.sh` returns 4 hits (was 0 at Sprint 4 close).

2. **Java enum layer** (no LOC changes outside the enums themselves):
   - **`TestRunArg`** added `AUTH_CREDENTIAL`. Critical fix: previous `toString()` was `name().toLowerCase()` which would produce `auth_credential` (with underscore). Updated to `name().toLowerCase().replace('_', '-')` so `AUTH_CREDENTIAL.toString() == "auth-credential"` matching the bash + REST API contract. The pre-existing `IUT.toString() == "iut"` is preserved (no underscore present).
   - **`SuiteAttribute`** added `AUTH_CREDENTIAL("authCredential", String.class)`.

3. **Java listener layer** (`SuiteFixtureListener.java`, ~30 LOC including javadoc):
   - `processSuiteParameters(ISuite)`: reads `params.get(TestRunArg.AUTH_CREDENTIAL.toString())`; when non-null and non-empty, stores via `suite.setAttribute(SuiteAttribute.AUTH_CREDENTIAL.getName(), authCredential)` and logs at CONFIG level (length only — never the value, per masking discipline).
   - `onStart(ISuite)`: after `registerRestAssuredFilters()`, reads the AUTH_CREDENTIAL attribute back off the suite and calls `configureRestAssuredAuthCredential((String) authCred)`.
   - `configureRestAssuredAuthCredential(String)` (new package-private method): no-op on null/empty; otherwise builds `new RequestSpecBuilder().addHeader("Authorization", authCredential).build()` and assigns to `RestAssured.requestSpecification`. Wrapped in try/catch with WARN log on RuntimeException so a defensive failure does not abort suite startup (same defensive pattern as `registerRestAssuredFilters`).

### Deviation from story technical notes

- Story §Technical Notes step 1 said "verify auth-credential is declared as a `ctl:form-param` in `src/main/scripts/ctl/ogcapi-connectedsystems10-suite.ctl`". On reading the CTL file: it defines a `<ctl:form>` for the interactive web-UI flow ONLY. The smoke-test.sh REST flow uses `/teamengine/rest/suites/{ets}/run` directly (TeamEngine's TestSuiteController endpoint), which accepts URL-encoded parameters as TestNG suite parameters without going through the CTL form-param mechanism. CTL file required NO changes for this fix. Story acceptance still satisfied since the contract is phrased as "→ CTL parameter `auth-credential`" — the REST `--data-urlencode` IS the equivalent at the TeamEngine API layer; no CTL edit was required.

### Unit test (TDD red→green)

`src/test/java/.../listener/VerifyAuthCredentialPropagation.java` — 8 @Tests, all PASS:

1. `testRunArg_AuthCredential_keyMatchesContract` — asserts `TestRunArg.AUTH_CREDENTIAL.toString() == "auth-credential"` (load-bearing: bash and REST API agree on this key).
2. `suiteAttribute_AuthCredential_present` — asserts `SuiteAttribute.AUTH_CREDENTIAL.getName() == "authCredential"` and type `String.class`.
3. `processSuiteParameters_setsAuthCredentialAttribute` — when both `iut` and `auth-credential` params present, listener calls `suite.setAttribute("authCredential", "Bearer ABCDEFGH12345678WXYZ")` (Mockito captor verification).
4. `processSuiteParameters_noAuthCredential_noAttribute` — backward-compat: `auth-credential` absent → `setAttribute("authCredential", ...)` is NEVER called (Mockito `verify(..., never())`).
5. `processSuiteParameters_emptyAuthCredential_noAttribute` — empty string treated as absent (defensive).
6. `configureRestAssuredAuthCredential_setsDefaultAuthHeader` — non-null/non-empty value sets `RestAssured.requestSpecification` to non-null.
7. `configureRestAssuredAuthCredential_nullValue_noop` — null → `requestSpecification` remains null (no Sprint 1-4 baseline change).
8. `configureRestAssuredAuthCredential_emptyValue_noop` — empty string → no-op.

TDD red→green sequence: tests written and committed first; tests fail to compile due to missing AUTH_CREDENTIAL symbols and configureRestAssuredAuthCredential method; production code added; tests now PASS.

### Test count delta

| Phase | mvn test surefire |
|---|---|
| Sprint 4 close baseline | 64 / 0 / 0 / 3 |
| Sprint 5 Run 1 close | 72 / 0 / 0 / 3 (+8 VerifyAuthCredentialPropagation) |

### Live three-fold cross-check status

DEFERRED to Quinn/Raze gate per Sprint 5 Run 1 worktree-pollution + Docker-time-budget mitigation pattern (precedent: Sprint 4 Run 2 credential-leak-e2e-test.sh deferral). The structural wiring is mvn-verified. Quinn or Raze runs `bash scripts/credential-leak-e2e-test.sh` from `/tmp/<role>-fresh-sprint5/` clone with `SMOKE_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/<role>-fresh-sprint5/test-results/` to produce the live three-fold evidence and archive.

### Acceptance criteria — at Sprint 5 Run 1 close

- [x] `grep -nE 'SMOKE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL|auth-credential' scripts/smoke-test.sh` returns non-empty (4 hits)
- [DEFERRED to gate] `scripts/credential-leak-e2e-test.sh` three-fold verdict (a)+(b)+(c) — Quinn/Raze run live
- [x] New unit test `VerifyAuthCredentialPropagation.java` covers all 4 layers (8/8 PASS)
- [x] `mvn test` BUILD SUCCESS surefire 72/0/0/3
- [x] Smoke baseline preserved (mvn unit suite green; live smoke deferred to gate)
- [DEFERRED to gate] SCENARIO-ETS-CLEANUP-CREDENTIAL-LEAK-WIRING-001 / -THREE-FOLD-001 PASS (live exec)

## Implementation Notes addendum (Sprint 6 S-ETS-06-03 META-GAP-1 reclassification — 2026-04-30)

The 8 `VerifyAuthCredentialPropagation` unit tests landed in this story verify **STRUCTURAL WIRING ONLY**. They exercise:
- `TestRunArg.AUTH_CREDENTIAL` key value (`"auth-credential"`)
- `SuiteAttribute.AUTH_CREDENTIAL` name + type
- `SuiteFixtureListener.processSuiteParameters` set/no-set/empty branches (Mockito verify)
- `SuiteFixtureListener.configureRestAssuredAuthCredential` set/null/empty branches

They do **NOT** exercise wire-side filter ordering. The `Mockito.verify(suite).setAttribute(...)` and `RestAssured.requestSpecification != null` checks confirm the wiring layers were called, but they cannot detect the filter-ordering defect that GAP-1' (Sprint 5 Raze 0.74 + meta-Raze 0.83 META-GAP-1) exposed: the `MaskingRequestLoggingFilter.filter()` could mutate `requestSpec` before `super.filter()` calls `ctx.next()` for HTTP transport, AND restore in finally — the Mockito verify would still PASS while the wire was poisoned.

**Wire-side proof lives in `VerifyWireRestoresOriginalCredential`** (Sprint 6 S-ETS-06-01 / REQ-ETS-CLEANUP-016). That test class uses a `CapturingFilterContext` that snapshots header values BY VALUE at `ctx.next` call time (a by-reference capture would read the post-restoration state and miss the bug — exactly what the legacy 16 wiring-only tests suffered).

**Future readers MUST NOT** conflate the 8/8 wiring PASS count from this story with credential safety. Sprint 5 GAP-1' demonstrated that all 16 wiring tests (8 from this story + 8 from `VerifyMaskingRequestLoggingFilter`) could PASS while the wire carried the masked form to the IUT. The wiring-only / wire-side distinction is now reflected in:
- spec.md REQ-ETS-CLEANUP-013 implementation notes
- spec.md REQ-ETS-CLEANUP-016 status block
- `VerifyMaskingRequestLoggingFilter` class javadoc (post Sprint 6 audit; 2 try/finally tests deleted, 6 retained as wiring-only)
- `VerifyAuthCredentialPropagation` continues to exist as wiring-only proof (no class-level javadoc edit needed; the spec.md note is the authoritative classification).
