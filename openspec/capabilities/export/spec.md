# Export & Sharing — Specification

> Version: 1.0 | Status: Frozen — v1.0 web app, superseded by ets-ogcapi-connectedsystems | Last updated: 2026-04-27
>
> **Frozen 2026-04-27.** TeamEngine renders TestNG/EARL HTML exports natively in the new ETS; see `openspec/capabilities/ets-ogcapi-connectedsystems/spec.md`.

## Purpose

Enable users to extract assessment results in portable, machine-readable (JSON) and human-readable (PDF) formats for archival, sharing with colleagues, inclusion in procurement evidence packages, and integration with external tooling. The JSON export uses a versioned schema to ensure forward-compatible consumption by downstream systems.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-EXP-001: JSON Export Availability
The system SHALL provide a JSON export action accessible from the results dashboard after an assessment has completed or has been cancelled (partial results).

### REQ-EXP-002: JSON Export Content — Results
The system SHALL include in the JSON export the full assessment results comprising: assessment metadata (server URL, assessment timestamp, tool version, schema version), summary counts (total, passed, failed, skipped, compliance percentage), per-conformance-class results (class name, class URI, pass/fail/skip badge, per-requirement results), and per-test results (requirement ID, requirement URI, test name, status, failure reason if applicable, skip reason if applicable).

### REQ-EXP-003: JSON Export Content — Request/Response Traces
The system SHALL include in the JSON export the complete request/response trace for every executed test, containing: HTTP method, full URL, request headers, request body (if present), response status code, response headers, response body (subject to the same truncation rules as REQ-CAP-008), and response time in milliseconds.

### REQ-EXP-004: JSON Export Credential Masking
The system SHALL apply credential masking to all request/response data included in the JSON export, using the same masking rules defined in REQ-CAP-006 and REQ-CAP-007.

### REQ-EXP-005: JSON Schema Versioning
The system SHALL include a `schemaVersion` field at the root level of every JSON export. The initial schema version SHALL be `"1"`. The schema version SHALL be incremented whenever a breaking change is made to the JSON export structure.

### REQ-EXP-006: JSON Export Schema Stability
The system SHALL treat the JSON export schema as a contract: fields present in a given schema version SHALL NOT be removed or have their type changed within that version. New fields MAY be added without incrementing the version (additive, non-breaking changes).

### REQ-EXP-007: JSON Export File Naming
The system SHALL name the exported JSON file using the pattern `csapi-compliance-{server-hostname}-{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}.json`, where `{server-hostname}` is derived from the assessed server URL and `{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}` is the assessment completion timestamp in UTC.

### REQ-EXP-008: JSON Export Valid JSON
The system SHALL produce a JSON export file that is valid JSON (parseable by any standards-conformant JSON parser) and encoded in UTF-8.

### REQ-EXP-009: PDF Export Availability
The system SHALL provide a PDF export action accessible from the results dashboard after an assessment has completed or has been cancelled (partial results).

### REQ-EXP-010: PDF Export Content — Summary Section
The system SHALL include in the PDF export a summary section containing: the assessed server URL, the assessment date and time, the tool version, and the same summary statistics shown on the dashboard (total, passed, failed, skipped, compliance percentage).

### REQ-EXP-011: PDF Export Content — Per-Class Results
The system SHALL include in the PDF export a per-conformance-class section listing each class with its name, URI, pass/fail/skip badge, and individual requirement pass/fail/skip counts.

### REQ-EXP-012: PDF Export Content — Failed Test Details
The system SHALL include in the PDF export a section for failed tests containing: the test name, the requirement ID and URI, the failure reason (including expected vs. actual behavior), and the request URL and response status code associated with the failure.

### REQ-EXP-013: PDF Export Disclaimer
The system SHALL include the unofficial status disclaimer (as defined in REQ-RPT-010) on the first page of every PDF export.

### REQ-EXP-014: PDF Export Readability
The system SHALL produce a PDF export that is text-selectable (not a rasterized image), uses legible font sizes (minimum 9pt body text), and includes page numbers on every page.

### REQ-EXP-015: Partial Results Export
The system SHALL allow both JSON and PDF export of partial results when an assessment has been cancelled before completion. The export SHALL clearly indicate that results are partial (e.g., a `"status": "partial"` field in JSON, a "Partial Results" label in PDF).

### REQ-EXP-016: JSON Export Disclaimer
The system SHALL include the unofficial status disclaimer text (as defined in REQ-RPT-010) as a `disclaimer` field at the root level of the JSON export.

## Acceptance Scenarios

### SCENARIO-EXP-JSON-001: Downloading a JSON Export
**GIVEN** an assessment has completed successfully
**WHEN** the user clicks the JSON export button on the results dashboard
**THEN** the browser downloads a `.json` file named according to the pattern `csapi-compliance-{hostname}-{timestamp}.json`.

**GIVEN** an assessment completed with 40 passed, 5 failed, 3 skipped
**WHEN** the user opens the exported JSON file
**THEN** the JSON contains a summary object with `total: 48`, `passed: 40`, `failed: 5`, `skipped: 3`, and `compliancePercent: 88.9`.

### SCENARIO-EXP-JSON-003: JSON Export Contains Per-Class Results
**GIVEN** an assessment covered 3 conformance classes
**WHEN** the user opens the exported JSON file
**THEN** the JSON contains an array of 3 conformance class objects, each with `name`, `uri`, `badge`, `passedCount`, `failedCount`, and `skippedCount` fields.

### SCENARIO-EXP-JSON-004: JSON Export Contains Request/Response Traces
**GIVEN** an assessment executed 20 tests
**WHEN** the user opens the exported JSON file
**THEN** each of the 20 test result objects includes a `trace` object containing `request` (with `method`, `url`, `headers`, `body`) and `response` (with `statusCode`, `headers`, `body`, `responseTimeMs`).

### SCENARIO-EXP-JSON-005: JSON Export Credentials Are Masked
