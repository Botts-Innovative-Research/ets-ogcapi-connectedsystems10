# Epic 04: Test Engine Infrastructure

> Status: Closed — v1.0 web app shipped at HEAD ab53658, no further sprints. Superseded by TestNG + REST Assured + ets-common in `epic-ets-01-scaffold` and `epic-ets-04-teamengine-integration`. | Last updated: 2026-04-27

## Goal
Build the core test engine that all conformance tests execute within. This includes test-to-requirement traceability, three-state result production, JSON schema validation, conformance class dependency ordering with cascade skip, pagination traversal, timeout enforcement, and graceful error handling.

## Dependencies
- Depends on: None (foundation epic)
- Blocks: Epic 01, Epic 02, Epic 03, Epic 05, Epic 06, Epic 08

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Every test maps 1:1 to a canonical OGC requirement URI; unregistered tests are rejected at startup
- [ ] Tests produce exactly one of pass/fail/skip with structured messages
- [ ] Response bodies are validated against JSON schemas loaded from the OGC 23-001 OpenAPI definition with full $ref resolution
- [ ] Conformance class dependency DAG is enforced; failures cascade to skip dependent classes
- [ ] Pagination follows `next` links with configurable page limits and loop detection
- [ ] Request timeouts and network errors produce test failures without crashing the assessment
